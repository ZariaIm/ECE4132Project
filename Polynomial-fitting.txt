% Use this template to design an open-loop system identification routine given
% the step time response of the patient. 

%% input response
% The input response is loaded here and used to simulate the patient to produce 
% the step response. Feel free to alter this section as needed to try different
% types of inputs that may help with the identification process
[time_vec, Food, InsulinRate] = inputVector();

% Simulate the open loop response of the generated patient
Sugar = openLoopSim(patient,Food,InsulinRate);

% Get Sugar values at time_vec time. This is basic linear interpolation and
% is nessesary because Simulink does not guarantee Sugar.Time will equal time_vec
sugar_vec = interp1(Sugar.Time,Sugar.Data,time_vec,'linear');

%% system ID using polynomial fitting:

% set useful params
IC = sugar_vec(1);

% extend data with constant final value, so polyfit smoothens at the end
time = 1:2000;
order = 7;
sugar_vec_extended = [sugar_vec, sugar_vec(end)*ones(1,time(end)-time_vec(end)-1)];
coeffs = polyfit(time, sugar_vec_extended-IC, order);   % fit curve of order n to patient data

% add step response for each term of the polynomial to TF
TF = 0;
s = tf('s');
for i = 1:length(coeffs)
    s_order = order - i + 1;
    TF = TF + coeffs(i)*factorial(s_order)/s^s_order; 
end
TF = minreal(TF);
